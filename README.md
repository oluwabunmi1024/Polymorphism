ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python using two activities:

Assignment 1 â€“ Design Your Own Class

A Smartphone class with attributes (brand, model, storage, battery).

Methods to simulate charging and using the phone.

A GamingPhone subclass that extends Smartphone with extra features (like playing games with faster battery drain).

Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and constructors.

Activity 2 â€“ Polymorphism Challenge

A Vehicle base class with a move() method.

Subclasses Car, Plane, and Boat that each define move() differently.

Demonstrates polymorphism (same method, different behaviors).
